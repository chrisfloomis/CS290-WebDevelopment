		<h1>2 - Make the Call</h1>
		<h6>by Chris Loomis</h6>
		<p>
			So you have your API Key and are ready to make the call.  So far the call should look like this
			<code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?appid={APIKEY}</code>
			Remember to replace {APIKEY} with your brand new API Key!
		</p>
		<p>
			Of note is the end of the URL before your API Key.  <code>/forecast/daily</code> is what we are going to use to
			retrieve the daily forecast, but there are plenty of calls that can be made to get different types of info.
			More info on those here: <a href="http://openweathermap.org/api">http://openweathermap.org/api</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			So back on topic, we do not have enough to make a call as Open Weather Map does not know <i>where</i> we 
			are forecasting.  There are a few options on how to tell them where.  For this How To I will be using
			<code>q=oakland</code> which will retrieve us info for Oakland, CA, USA.
		</p>
		<p>
			The <code>q</code> stands for query and <code>oakland</code> will default to Oakland, CA, but what if we
			needed to forecast for Oakland, MO?  If you add the state to the end it will work, so <code>q=oakland,mo</code>
			will return the forecast for Oakland, MO.  However this is still not the most precise and Open Weather Map
			Actually recommends using the city's ID.
		</p>
		<p>
			To use the city ID, you will replace <code>q=oakland</code> with <code>id=5378538</code>. How did I get the id?
			I made the following call using the API, and the JSON object returned happens to have the code.
			<div>
				<code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?appid={APIKEY}&q=oakland</code>
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			This is not helpful for the beginner however.  Open Weather Map suggests downloading their list of cities and ids from here
			<a href="http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.us.json.gz">http://bulk.openweathermap.org/sample/city.list.us.json.gz</a>.
			This is a long text file with the city id's, city names, country, and coordinates in the form of longitude and latitude.
			I do not find this too helpful, as if you want Oakland, MO the only way to confirm you have the correct Oakland is by the coords.
		</p>
		<p>
			So whether you know the coords or google for them, This is the last way you can make a call to Open Weather Map.
			To do so, replace <code>q=oakland</code> or <code>id=5378538</code> with <code>lon=-122.270798&lat=37.804371</code>.
			You will want to be that precise with them, as the slightest deviation will get you a neighboring town.  
		</p>
		<p>
			Ultimately, the easiest way is to just use the city name with state/province and country.  Here it is in it's final form
			with the other two methods following.
			<div>
				<code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?appid={APIKEY}&q=oakland,ca,us</code><br>
				<code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?appid={APIKEY}&id=5378538</code><br>
				<code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?appid={APIKEY}&lon=-122.270798&lat=37.804371</code>
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			All 3 of the examples above will return the 7 day forecast for Oakland, CA, but Open Weather Map can return up to 16 days!
			To return all 16 you can simply add a count with <code>cnt=16</code>, or replace 16 with any number between 1 and 16.  If
			a number is entered not in range it will default back to 7.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you looked through the block of returned JSON you probably didn't understand the temperatures as there are no units attached.
			The default is Kelvin for temperature and meters/second for wind speed.  This means to most the info is meaningless as few
			regularly use Kelvins.  Thankfully we can just add <code>units=metric</code> for Celsius, or if you're American 
			<code>units=imperial</code> for Fahrenheit and Miles per Hour.  Being American myself, I will be using imperial, so our final
			request for this How To is as follows:
			<div>
				<code>http://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast/daily?appid={APIKEY}&q=oakland,ca,us&cnt=7&units=imperial</code><br>
				<i>Note: I am making a 7 day forecast and as that is the default I did not need to add the count.</i>
			</div>
		</p>
		<p>
			With the call out of the way, we can finally get to dissecting the information returned!
