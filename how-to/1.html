			But before we can even get started, you will need to register for an API code which you can sign up for free
			here: <a href="http://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up">http://home.openweathermap.org/users/sign_up</a>
		</p>
		<p>
			If you followed the link you will see that it is incredibly easy to obtain your own API code by entering a username,
			email, password, and agreeing to their terms of service.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the following steps I will refer to the API Key as {APIKEY} and you should make sure to replace it with your own key.
